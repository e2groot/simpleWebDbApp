# simpleWebDbApp
The goal of this project is to write a multi-layered web application in Kotlin that leverages dependency injection 
to perform simple CRUD operations, and runs as a DropWizard project.

I am looking to design this app in such a way that I can plug and play with database (relational/noSQL) into this app to learn how they work (i.e. MongoDB) and also do some UI development and some web development to talk to the app's services.

It is still in development; however, at the moment it is in its base state to begin adding features as separate branches.

Down the road, I would also like to dockerize the services this will host to do more with it.
