# simpleWebDbApp
The goal of this project is to write a multi-layered web application in Kotlin that leverages dependency injection 
to perform simple CRUD operations, and runs as a DropWizard project.  It is still in development; however, at the moment it is in its base state to begin adding features as separate branches.

Down the road, I would also like to dockerize the services this will host to do more with it.
